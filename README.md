# RSDataSetConverter

Remote sensing image detection is an important task in the field of computer vision. At present, there are many kinds of open source remote sensing image data sets but their label formats are not uniform. 

RSDataSetConverter is just a tool to solve this problem which can convert the label files of various remote sensing data sets into standard Pascal VOC or YOLO format.
